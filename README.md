# Sales Performance Dashboard Analysis

### Overview
- This project showcases a Sales Performance Dashboard developed to analyze key sales metrics and provide actionable insights. Built using modern data visualization techniques, it highlights total sales, discounts, net sales, cost of goods sold (COGS), and profits, along with trends over time and segment performance.

### Problem Statement
- The objective was to create a comprehensive dashboard to monitor sales performance across different countries, months, products, and segments. The challenge included identifying profit trends, optimizing product sales strategies, and addressing potential seasonal impacts on revenue.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

- Profit Trends: Analyzed monthly profit generation, noting a peak of 3M in November and subsequent decline, suggesting seasonality or market shifts.
- Product Sales: Identified top-performing products like Passo (2.0M units) and VTT (1.5M units), indicating strong market demand.
- Segment Performance: Highlighted Government and Small Business segments as key revenue drivers (2.0M and 1.5M respectively).
- Geographical Distribution: Units sold by country (e.g., 20.1% Canada, 26.4% USA) reveal regional sales concentration opportunities.

### Data Visualization

- Implemented charts including line graphs for profit trends, bar charts for product and segment sales, and pie charts for country-wise unit distribution.
Utilized interactive filters for Country and Month to enhance user experience.

### Technologies Used

- MicroSoft Excel for Data Cleaning and Manupulation
- Power BI for Data Visulization

### Insights and Recommendations

- Leverage high-performing products (Passo, VTT) and segments (Government, Small Business) to stabilize profits.
- Investigate November profit peak causes and mitigate seasonal dips.
- Focus marketing efforts in high-unit-sale countries (USA, Canada).




### Future Improvements

- Add real-time data integration.
- Incorporate predictive analytics for sales forecasting.
- Enhance UI/UX with additional interactive elements.
